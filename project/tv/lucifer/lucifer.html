			<p id="syn">Bored and unhappy as the Lord of Hell, LUCIFER MORNINGSTAR has abandoned his throne and retired to L.A., where he owns Lux, an upscale nightclub. Charming, charismatic and devilishly handsome, Lucifer (Tom Ellis) is enjoying his retirement, indulging in a few of his favorite things wine, women and song when a beautiful pop star is brutally murdered outside of Lux. For the first time in roughly 10 billion years, he feels something awaken deep within him as a result of this murder. Compassion? Sympathy? The very thought disturbs him as well as his best friend and confidante, Mazikeen (Lesley-Ann Brandt), a fierce demon in the form of a beautiful young woman. The murder attracts the attention of LAPD homicide detective CHLOE DANCER, who initially is dismissive of Lucifer. But she becomes intrigued by his talent for drawing out peoples secrets and his desire to dispense justice, doling out punishment to those who deserve it. As they work together to solve the pop stars murder, Lucifer is struck by Chloes inherent goodness. Accustomed to dealing with the absolute worst of humanity, Lucifer is intrigued by Chloes apparent purity and begins to wonder if theres hope for his own soul yet. At the same time, Gods emissary, the angel Amendiel (D.B. Woodside), has been sent to Los Angeles to convince Lucifer to return to the underworld can the Devil incarnate be tempted toward the side of Good, or will his original calling pull him back toward Evil?

				<ol>
					
					<li><h5>Pilot</h5><br/>Lucifer Morningstar, the retired ruler of Hell, owns a high-end night club in Los Angeles. When the pop star he tries to help is murdered in front of him by a drug dealer, he uses his powers of persuasion to assist Detective Chloe Decker in apprehending the true culprit behind the murder. All the while, he must deal with his brother, the dark-winged angel Amenadiel, who is putting pressure on him from their father to return to running Hell.</li><br/><br/>
					
					<li><h5>Lucifer, Stay. Good Devil.</h5><br/>Lucifer and Chloe work together again to solve a homicide, this time that of a movie star's son who was killed by an overeager paparazzo who frequently created volatile situations in order to get the "first scoop" on the story.</li><br/><br/>
					
					<li><h5>The Would-Be Prince of Darkness</h5><br/>When a football star whom Lucifer convinced to lose his virginity is arrested for the murder of the girl with whom he had sex, Lucifer works to prove his innocence.</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>Manly Whatnots</h5><br/>Chloe and Lucifer investigate a missing persons case involving a girl, Lindsay Jolson, who was involved with a pick-up artist. The investigation is complicated by Lucifer's repeated attempts to seduce Chloe in an effort to better understand her. Meanwhile, Amenadiel confronts a reluctant Mazikeen about Lucifer. At Lucifer's encouragement, Chloe shoots him in the leg. To Lucifer's bewilderment, he feels pain and bleeds.</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>Sweet Kicks</h5><br/>Chloe begs Lucifer to help her in a case involving an artist/high-end shoe designer who was once in a street gang. In doing so, Lucifer knowingly puts himself in danger, finding it exciting to test his mortality. He and Chloe are ultimately rescued from a hostile situation by Mazikeen. Meanwhile, Amenadiel surprises Dr. Martin by showing up at her office after hours, stating he is a fellow psychotherapist, who has just moved into the office next door. The two agree to have drinks and openly discuss patients.</li><br/><br/>
					
					<li><h5>Favorite Son</h5><br/>When a warehouse is robbed and the security guard murdered, it turns out that the stolen container belongs to Lucifer. He and Chloe then work to find the culprit, which Lucifer sees as protecting his reputation in the city. Meanwhile, Lucifer continues to struggle with his identity and Amenadiel continues to try to use Dr. Martin to get to Lucifer. It is revealed that the stolen shipping container holds Lucifer's wings.</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>Wingman</h5><br/>Lucifer continues the search for his wings and turns to Amenadiel for help. Amenadiel rejects at first, so Lucifer enlists Chloe to assist him. Meanwhile, Chloe asks Dan for help in investigating the Palmetto case in the hopes that she can find something to confirm her suspicions against Malcolm, the cop who is in coma. The wings are apparently about to be sold at an auction. Lucifer goes to the auction where Amenadiel shows up to help Lucifer. Lucifer regains his wings, but burns them to anger Amenadiel and halt his own return to his former throne as the King of Hell. Whereas, Chloe and Dan find a new lead on the Palmetto case.</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>Et Tu, Doctor?</h5><br/>Feeling reborn, Lucifer celebrates his "rebirthday" at the Lux. And Malcolm, who wakes up from his coma, also celebrates his coming back. Chloe and Lucifer investigate the murder of a controversial therapist who advocates adultery as a means of saving relationships. Meanwhile, Lucifer shoehorns his own therapist, Dr. Linda Martin, into the case in an attempt to "solve" Chloe's issue with Dan. While solving the murder case, Lucifer realizes what is happening to him. Malcolm meets Chloe to explain that whoever shot him dead clearly does not have a problem shooting cops. Chloe and Lucifer then look for Malcolm's partner but find him dead with a suicide note, while Dan mysteriously meets with Malcolm.</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>A Priest Walks into a Bar</h5><br/>Lucifer and Chloe investigate when a priest asks for Lucifer's help in stopping a drug ring he believes is being headed by the counselor at a local youth center. However, a problem arises when the youth counselor is found dead and suspicion quickly falls on the priest. Meanwhile, Amenadiel meets with Malcolm to discuss the reason he brought him back from Hell, which is to kill someone.</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>Pops</h5><br/>Chloe and Lucifer investigate the poisoning death of the owner/chef at an upscale Mexican restaurant whom Lucifer admires. Suspicion falls on the owner's estranged son, a recovering drug addict, and the sous-chef, Anne, who would assume control of the restaurant if the son were out of the picture. The investigation is complicated by the surprise arrival of Chloe's mother, Penelope Decker, whom Lucifer also much admires. At home, Chloe and Penelope argue about Trixie, causing Trixie to run away to find Lucifer, but she ends up making friends with Mazikeen. Meanwhile, Malcolm reveals to Dan his plan to kill Lucifer, as directed by Amenadiel, and Mazikeen starts visiting Dr. Martin as a patient. Dan meets with Malcolm again saying that he could not let Malcolm kill Lucifer, so they end up fighting and Dan is knocked unconscious.</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>St. Lucifer</h5><br/>Lucifer finds doing charitable work thrilling and begins to explore it by donating to a local charity in honor of its murdered founder, Tim Dunlear. Amenadiel finds unlikely companionship. Meanwhile, Dan, held captive by Malcolm, tries to escape and warn Lucifer before Malcolm gets to him. Also, Lucifer learns something new about his mortality.</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>#TeamLucifer</h5><br/>When a member of a satanic church is killed, Lucifer is greatly disturbed that anyone would kill in his name. When it turns out that Malcolm is the one killing those people to honor him, Lucifer threatens torment but then he is interrupted by Amenadiel, which allows Malcolm to run away. They start fighting each other until they are stopped by Mazikeen. Later, Chloe stops by the Lux to talk to Lucifer, but instead finds the dead body of the street preacher who was seen arguing with Lucifer on TV. Elsewhere, Lucifer's realization that Chloe makes him physically vulnerable leads to him becoming paranoid</li><br/><br/>

					<li><h5>Take Me Back to Hell</h5><br/>Amenadiel saves Lucifer from being arrested by Chloe and they go to Amenadiel's office to talk. Dr. Martin shows up and advises the brothers. They go looking for Malcolm while Mazikeen helps Chloe hunt for Lucifer. Amenadiel finds Malcolm, they fight and Malcolm wounds Amenadiel with one of Mazikeen's daggers. Mazikeen saves the dying Amenadiel with the feather she kept from Lucifer's wings. Dan turns himself in clearing Lucifer of the murder. Chloe seizes Malcolm's money and he kidnaps Trixie to force her to give it back. At the exchange, Lucifer is fatally shot when he intervenes to try and save Chloe and Trixie. Lucifer prays to God offering to return to work for him if he saves Chloe. God restores Lucifer's powers and they kill Malcolm. A worried Lucifer tells Amenadiel that God has asked him to hunt for a soul who has escaped from Hell, their mother.</li><br/><br/>
